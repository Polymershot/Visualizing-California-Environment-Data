# Visualizing California Environmental Data using CalEnviroScreen4.0

## Description
With this project, I wanted to see how far I could get in replicating the dashboard created by the CalEnviroScreen4.0 researchers. Using Shiny and R, I was able to do a basic copy which includes filtering by county and city. Due to RAM limits placed by shinapps.io, the user can only select a certain number of columns before the app crashes.
